- Click analytics: device and location breakdowns
- Authentication: sign up, log in, and protected routes
- Dashboard to manage links and view stats

### ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- React 19 + Vite 7
- React Router 7
- Supabase (`@supabase/supabase-js`)
- Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
- Recharts for visualizations

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase project (URL + anon/public key)

### 1) Clone and install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd URL-Shortener-App
npm install
```

### 2) Configure environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Supabase credentials (these are referenced in `src/db/supabase.js`).

```bash
# .env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_or_service_key
```

### 3) Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL in your browser.

Key files:

- `src/db/supabase.js`: initializes Supabase using `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`.
- `src/db/apiUrls.js`: CRUD for short URLs and analytics.
- `src/pages/RedirectLink.jsx`: resolves a short code and redirects while recording a click.

---

## Environment Variables

The app expects the following variables (loaded via Vite):

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY`

Ensure they are present in `.env` (not committed) and configured in your host (Vercel/Netlify) for production.

---

## Development Notes

- Uses Tailwind CSS v4; utility classes are applied in `src/index.css` and components.
- UI components leverage Radix primitives and shadcn-style utilities.
- Charts are rendered with Recharts where applicable.

---

## Build and Deploy

### Local production preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### Deploying

- Vercel or Netlify recommended.
- Set env vars `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY` in your hosting provider.
- Use the `npm run build` output (Vite static assets) as the deployment artifact.
